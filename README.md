# üêæ Virtual Pet API üêæ

Welcome to the Virtual Pet API! This project allows users to interact with a virtual pet, managing its needs to keep it happy and healthy. Users can authenticate, manage pets, and perform various actions to maintain their pet‚Äôs wellbeing. Administrators have additional control over all pets in the system.

---


## üìú Project Description

The Virtual Pet API provides endpoints for creating and managing user accounts, authenticating with JWT, and allowing users to interact with their pets. Each pet has attributes like health and happiness, which users must manage to keep their pet thriving. If the pet's health drops to zero, a visual indicator‚Äîa "death icon"‚Äîwill appear, signaling that the pet urgently needs to be fed to restore its health. Administrators can view and manage all pets.
üöÄ Technologies Used

    Spring Boot: Framework for building REST APIs.
    Spring Security: Secures the application with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
    JPA (Java Persistence API): Manages data persistence in relational databases.
    Swagger and WebJars: Provides interactive API documentation.

    Note: MongoDB integration is planned for future updates to support additional features.

## üêæ Pet Management

Users can take care of their pets through various interactions. Key features include:

    View User Pets: GET /virtualpet/user/pets - Retrieves the list of pets associated with the authenticated user.
    Feed the Pet: POST /virtualpet/user/pets/{petId}/feed - Increases the pet's health and happiness.
    Play with the Pet: POST /virtualpet/user/pets/{petId}/play - Boosts the pet's happiness.

## üìä Health Indicator

Each pet has a health attribute that must be maintained through regular care. When health reaches zero, the pet's icon changes to a "death icon," indicating the pet needs to be fed immediately to recover.

    Pet Status: Alive

    Pet Status: Health Zero (Death Icon)

---    

## üëë Admin Privileges

Admins have elevated access to manage all pets in the system:

    View All Pets: GET /virtualpet/admin/pets - Retrieves a list of all pets across users (requires admin privileges).

## üì¨ Using the API with Postman

To simplify testing and interaction with the Virtual Pet API, a pre-configured Postman collection is included. This collection contains all the essential endpoints for authentication, pet management, and admin functionalities.
How to Use the Postman Collection:

    Download the Collection: Download the provided Postman collection file and save it locally.

    Import the Collection in Postman:
        Open Postman.
        Click on Import in the top-left corner of the Postman app.
        Select the Virtual Pet API.postman_collection.json file you downloaded.
        The collection will appear in your Postman workspace with all the endpoints organized for easy access.

    Set Up Environment Variables:
        Create a new environment in Postman with the following variables:
            base_url: The base URL of your API, e.g., http://localhost:8080 if running locally.
            jwt_token: This will hold your JWT token after login to authenticate requests.
            
    After logging in, copy the JWT token from the login response and paste it into the jwt_token environment variable to access protected endpoints.

## üìÑ Database Setup

To set up the MySQL database for the Virtual Pet API, you can use the following SQL script.

```sql

-- Create the 'virtualfpet' database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS virtualfpet;

-- Use the 'virtualfpet' database
USE virtualfpet;

-- Table to store users
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- The username must be unique
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,              -- Field for the role (e.g., ADMIN, USER)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table to store pets
CREATE TABLE pets (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    owner_id BIGINT,
    hunger INT DEFAULT 100,
    cleanliness INT DEFAULT 100,
    happiness INT DEFAULT 100,
    energy INT DEFAULT 100,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

## Instructions

    Copy the SQL script above.
    Run the script in your MySQL client or command line to create the necessary tables for the application.
